# Welcome to the exercise 1.4 of Becode js-web

For this exercise, I use the Becode Template

To see the result on [GithubPage](https://nadtr.github.io/js-web-1.4/)



## The exercise: **Age calculator**

Display three select boxes allowing to enter a birthdate. When the user selects a value for each of the select boxes, display its age.

*Bonus: Make your components smart by making it impossible to enter a date that doesn't exist. (Like 1990-04-31 or 1991-02-29.)*
