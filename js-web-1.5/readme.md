# Welcome to the exercise 1.5 of Becode js-web

For this exercise, I use the Becode Template

To see the result on [GithubPage](https://nadtr.github.io/js-web-1.6/)



## The exercise:  **Cat cycler**
Use your Google Images skills to collect a dozen of cat images.

Display these cat images in your app one by one by cycling automatically every second. These images must be displayed in a 500x500 pixel square and should be resized and cropped automatically to fit in this space regardless of their original resolution or aspect-ratio. (Purposedly choosing images that all have the same resolution or aspect-ratio is considered cheating.)

Bonus: Choose cats that are really really cute.
