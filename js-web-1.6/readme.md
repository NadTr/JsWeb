# Welcome to the exercise 1.6 of Becode js-web

For this exercise, I use the Becode Template

To see the result on [GithubPage](https://nadtr.github.io/js-web-1.6/)



## The exercise:  **Cat randomizer**
Re-use the collection of cat images you made for the last exercise but this time display all of them at the same time in 100x100 pixel squares. When you click on a button randomize the order of the cats.

This screen should be fully responsive and display nicely even on phones. (Use your browser's device emulation mode to test.)
